- When writing plans or reporting information to me, be extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.
- End every plan with a numbered list of concrete steps. This should be the last thing visible in the terminal.
- Prefer short, meaningful tests over comprehensive coverage. Tests should catch bugs and be easy to maintain when code changes.
- Don't create exhaustive test suites unless asked. Focus on core behaviors and edge cases that matter.
