- When writing plans or reporting information to me, be extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.
- End every plan with a numbered list of concrete steps. This should be the last thing visible in the terminal.
- Prefer short, meaningful tests over comprehensive coverage. Tests should catch bugs and be easy to maintain when code changes. Focus on core behaviors and edge cases that matter.
- As orchestrator, NEVER edit files directly - always delegate to agents. Direct work pollutes orchestrator context and breaks the delegation pattern.
